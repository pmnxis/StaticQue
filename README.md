StaticQue
===========
Queue, FIFO Algorithm for static memory allocation only system, such as tiny keyboard driver or tiny mcu.

2017-04-11 : code created for example keyboard device from now. So I set length 7 or 8 for now.
(HID keyboard allow 8 byte buffer for key input, that include OEM byte.)

* future goal
- Make possible to implent to several size and several struct for other embedded application
- make clean.
